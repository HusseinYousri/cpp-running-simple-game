# C++ Runner Game Improved

## Overview
This project demonstrates my learning journey in game development using C++ and the Raylib library. It includes features such as an endless moving background, animations, and a collision system using rectangles.

## Key Learnings
- **Game Loop**: Improved understanding of the game loop structure.
- **Collision System**: Implemented a better collision system using rectangles.
- **For Loops**: Enhanced usage of `for` loops for managing multiple objects.
- **Endless Background**: Created an endless moving background effect.
- **Animations**: Learned how animations work and how to implement them.
- **Resource Management**: Understood the importance of unloading textures after use.

## Final Thoughts
I consider this project complete and do not plan to revisit it. However, if I were to improve anything, it would definitely be the code organization.
